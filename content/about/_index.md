I am Umair Saeed, a Software Engineer living in Silicon Valley. I have deep expertise in creating products for mobile, desktop and web. Most recently, I am focused on backend web services and APIs, and iOS development.

I am an [avid reader](http://www.goodreads.com/umairsd), and generally love learning new things. In the technology domain, I particularly enjoy learning new programming languages. The most recent language that I toyed around with is Haskell.

I am a member of [ACM](http://www.acm.org) and [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org), as well as IEEE's [Computer Society](http://www.computer.org). For the curious, here are some of my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/umairsd), a few [GitHub repos](https://github.com/umairsd), and my [LinkedIn Profile](www.linkedin.com/in/umairsd).

You can e-mail me at umairsd at acm dot org, or follow me on twitter [@umairsd](https://twitter.com/umairsd).
