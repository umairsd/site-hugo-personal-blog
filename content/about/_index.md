I am Umair Saeed, a Software Engineer living in Silicon Valley. I have deep expertise in creating products for mobile, desktop and web. Most recently, I have been focused on backend web services and APIs, and iOS development.

I am an [avid reader](http://www.goodreads.com/umairsd) (both fiction and non-fiction). I love learning new things, and particularly enjoy trying out new technologies & programming languages. Currently (in 2023), I have been ramping up on Rust and Python, and going deep into Machine Learning and AI.

I am a member of the [ACM](http://www.acm.org) and [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org), as well as IEEE's [Computer Society](http://www.computer.org). For the curious, here are some of my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/umairsd), a few [GitHub repos](https://github.com/umairsd), and my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umairsd). The PDF version of [my resume is here](/data/UmairSaeedResume.pdf).
