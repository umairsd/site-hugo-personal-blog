I am Umair Saeed, a Software Engineer living in Silicon Valley. I have deep expertise in creating products for mobile, desktop and web.

I love learning about programming languages, tools, technologies. My current interests are iOS development, Haskell, and Machine Learning.

I am a member of [ACM](http://www.acm.org) and [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org), as well as IEEE's [Computer Society](http://www.computer.org). For the curious, here are some of my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/umairsd), a few [GitHub repos](https://github.com/umairsd), and my [LinkedIn Profile](www.linkedin.com/in/umairsd).

When I am not programming, I love to read books ([my Goodreads profile](http://www.goodreads.com/umairsd)) and tinker around with Legos.

You can e-mail me at umairsd at acm dot org, or follow me on twitter [@umairsd](https://twitter.com/umairsd).
